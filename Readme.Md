Personal use kernel project

Long-term aim:

* Be able to SSH into the device.
* Have the device do TCP/IP traffic routing.

There is no need to use the hard disk. This is "RAM only" for now. Disk access later -
depending on how difficult things turn out to be without.


The `Makefile` uses a cross-compiler built by the instructions from OS Wiki.
